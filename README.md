Test your general knowledge and get pub quiz ready!

Pub Quizzes are played all around the world, but they are especially popular in the UK. It is estimated that over half the pubs in the UK host a regular quiz night, thats roughly 23,600 pubs!

[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/explore/activity/Pub_quizzes) show that 98% of people surveyed have heard of a pub quiz, and are rated as the 19th most popular social activity.

During lockdowns pub quizzes remained popular - they just changed format to become virtual. This gave me the idea of creating a quiz site that would feel like a pub quiz, where users could play on their own to improve their general knowledge anywhere and at any time.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Red and green  are very typical colours in traditional British public houses, with the red & green used for upholstery.

* I have used #f5f5f5 & #000000 as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used #292929 as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used # a50c3c for the border of the modal and to display the wrong answers.
* I have used #047638 to display the correct answer.

  ![The Quiz Arms Color Scheme](documentation/color-scheme.webp)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Almendra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Almendra?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=almendra). Almendra is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen it as it looks like the type of font you would see on a pubs name sign, slightly medieval looking and grand.

![Almendra Font Example](documentation/almendra.webp)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=quicksand). QuickSand is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.

![Quicksand Font Example](documentation/quicksand.webp)

### Imagery

As the website is called The Quiz Arms, I wanted to use an image for the page background of a pub to give the user the feeling that they are participating in a pub quiz.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Home Page](documentation/wireframes/homewireframe.webp)
![Difficulty Page](documentation/wireframes/difficultywireframe.webp)
![Game Page](documentation/wireframes/gamewireframe.webp)
![High Scores Page](documentation/wireframes/highscorewireframe.webp)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a games page, a high scores page and a 404 error page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.
  
  ![favicon](documentation/favicon-image.webp)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
  ![The Quiz Arms Title](documentation/the-quiz-arms-banner.png)

#### The Home Page

The home page of The Quiz Arms displays the sites name as a title and then a container which holds some welcome text. Below this are three buttons, how to play, play and high scores.

![Home page image](LINK TO GO HERE)

1. How to play - This button opens a modal showing the user how to play the game. The modal contains a close button which will close the modal, and show the home page again.
  ![Modal open image](LINK TO GO HERE)
2. Play - This button will redirect the user to the game page to select the difficulty of their quiz.
3. High Scores - This button redirects the user to the high scores page.

#### The Game Page

The game page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Initially on the game page you will be shown a container with three buttons to select the difficulty of the quiz the user can choose from.

![Image of the game page difficulty selection buttons](LINK TO GO HERE)

Once the user has selected their difficulty they will then be shown the quiz area. The quiz area contains the question and the 4  answer choices.

![Image of quiz area](LINK TO GO HERE)

#### The High Scores Page

The high scores page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page.

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page container there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user is then given a choice of three buttons to redirect them to other pages on the site, the home page, the games page and the high scores page.

![Error page image](LINK GOES HERE)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to select the amount of questions in their quiz.
2. Look into making the quiz a multiplayer game, so that it could be played by teams, which would make the quiz even more like a pub quiz.
3. Create a back end database to enable me to store scores which would then allow you to see how you scored against other players.
4. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [index.html](testing/w3/w3-index.webp) - Passed.
* [game.html](testing/w3/w3-game.webp) - No errors, 1 Warning. The warning is for an empty H2 tag. This is where the question is inserted using jQuery.
* [highscores.html](testing/w3/w3-highscores.webp) - Passed.
* [404.html](testing/w3/w3-404.webp) - Passed.

* [style.css](LINK TO IMG HERE) - Passed, no errors found.

### JavaScript Validator

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript.

* [javascript.js](testing/jshint/jshint-javascript-js.png) - Passed.
* [game.js](testing/jshint/jshint-game-js.png) - Passed with one warning. Async functions are only available in ES8. It also stated that there are 4 unused variables, however these are being used.
* [highscores.js](testing/jshint/jshint-highscores-js.png) - Passed.

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | An error was displaying in the console when next was clicked after the first question, stating that results wasn't defined. | Data was defined in the callApi(), so couldn't be accessed as it was in local scope rather than global scope. By defining data globally and then passing the data as a parameter into the getQuestion() in the nextQuestion() solved this. |
| 2 | The Questions being pulled in from the JSON have characters that are not escaped and therefore display incorrectly with symbols in place of the correct characters. ![Characters not escaping correctly in the JSON data](documentation/characters-not-escaped.webp) | After a lot of research into escaping characters, I came across a post on slack that mentioned using innerHTML rather than innerText. Once I changed the answers to innerHTML the characters are now displaying correctly. |
| 3 | I have the local storage set up to save the final score as mostRecentScore. However when completing a game and submitting the team name the score added to the high scores section would be the previous score and not the most recent score. | After a lot of research to try and find out why this was happening I went over the code again and decided to see if I changed mostRecentScore in the scoreLog to score it would make a difference. By changing this, I have solved the issue and it now pulls the most recent score achieved. |
| 4 | Players were able to select an answer which would then display whether correct or incorrect. However they could still click on the answers which meant they could click all the answers to receive the points.| I researched a way to disable the buttons and initially found that I could use answer1.disabled = true; This worked, however it added quite a bit of code, as I had to add this for each button. Further research led me to find [this article](https://blog.revillweb.com/jquery-disable-button-disabling-and-enabling-buttons-with-jquery-5e3ffe669ece) which showed how to use jQuery and the class on the buttons to enable and disable them all at the same time. This then allows me to enable the buttons when a new question has been populated and once a selection has been made, the answer buttons are disabled until the user clicks next to advance onto the next question. |

## Credits

### Code Used

* I used [this You Tube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5OW46yO8I) to learn how to create a modal for the how to play section.

* As the API I used for the questions declared the correct answer and then had an array of incorrect answers, I had to find a way to shuffle the answers together so that the correct answer wouldn't always appear on the same button. Research led me to the Fisher-Yates Shuffle. Other methods of shuffling can favour some items in the array more than others, however the Fisher Yates Shuffle allows for a more even spread of probability of the answer being placed on each button. I used the following [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eATLMjs7y4s&list=PL5egNEXQTWmFHAoWFVRLNAvD-9zzyWVxA&index=3) to further adapt the shuffle I had researched on W3Schools to work with the data I had.

As the JavaScript modules of the Code Institute Diploma did not cover local storage, I had to do a bit of research into this topic myself in order to set up the high scores section of my site.

* I used this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhmNLKwwGw&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=9) on YouTube by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-T8W79DN6PBnzomelvqJYw) which taught me to save the team name and score to an object, that would then be saved into an array in local storage. It also explained how to sort the items in the array into descending score order, and then to splice the array, I have used the MAX_HIGH_SCORES as my point to splice.

* I used this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOv18lCMmw&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=10) on YouTube by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-T8W79DN6PBnzomelvqJYw) to learn how to insert the local storage into the high scores page.

### Content

All questions for my site were pulled from [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) using their API.

All other content for the site, such as introduction messages and instructions were written by myself.
